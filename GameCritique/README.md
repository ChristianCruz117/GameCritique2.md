 ## God of War 4
 The God of War 4 the newest game of its franchise is a single player third person action adventure game and it is open world. The makers
 of God of War 4 are Santa Monica Studios. In this game you are Kratos the ghost of Sparta after taking revege over the gods of Olympus and
 he is much older and has a son and living in the realm of the Norse gods going on a very important quest. In the game Kratos has to fight 
 monsters and collect collectibles and do side quest to get rare items and armor that can help him in his quest. After playing the entire game in a couple days, I think there are a few things a game tester would look at.
  
 One of the functions that the developers had to deffinatly test was the combat of the game. This deffiatly needs to be tested because thats how Kratos goes around the game killing things and also it helps him finish puzzels. Also the main wepon of his, his axe needs to be tested because you can throw it, charge throw it at enemies, make it get stick to objects, and magically retrive it back like Thors hammer. Another thing they deffinatly had to test was the armor system. They deffinatly had to test how to upgrade the armor you have and its stats. Also how you can equip stones wich give you blessings or in other words buffs and also it increases youre strangth and magic abilities depending on what you like.
Lastly one of the most important thing they had test was how Kratos was son would play right by him. This one is super important because he is gonna be helping you in the game. He shots arrows at the enemies also can summon animals to youre aid that can do many things and do elemental damage, also distract enemies so you dont feel overwhelmed.
